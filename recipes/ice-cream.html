    <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from milk or cream that has been flavored with a sweetener, such as sugar, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. It is sometimes colored with food coloring and stabilized with stabilizers. Ice cream is typically served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by the hands as finger food.</p>
    <p>The origins of frozen desserts are obscure, although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BC. The first recorded instance of ice cream in the United States was in 1744.</p>
